readability-newsplus-plugin
===========================

News+ is an android 'reader of RSS readers' that allows off line reading of multiple services in a single app.

It is modular to allow plugins to interface to various news/rss/read-it-later etc services.

This is the Readability plugin.

Readability is a service that allows 'read it later' functionality (bookmark/store/retrieve) and simplifies pages
easy reading - especailly on mobile devices.

This plug in had been developed by others to beta, but not progressed - so I copied it here to build and use myself.
But if others want to use it...

My initial input is just to:-
- Make it compilable from a single download/clone
- Copied sherlock tool bar library into libs dir, and removed another dependency.
- Added a bin dir for the APK

Probably a better way to do all this in GIT - but I don't know it :)
